			<li><a href="Haskell-and-math.en.html">Haskell and mathematics (and the way I relate to them)</a>. A short personal writing about the topic. How can Haskell and mathematics strengthen each other mutually, and why it is necessary to keep an openness towards the whole of mathematics?</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/alignalghii/CL-zipper-RWS">A combinatory logic evaluator</a>. My own interpreter for a mini lazy functional programming language, implemented in Haskell. A minimalistic, but still Turing complete functional programming language, having all advantages of being lazy in the term evaluation/ reduction strategy. The implementation tries to be as clean as possible (it uses the zipper technique to achieve the leftmost outermost reduction strategy, thus ensuring lazy evaluation). The main algorithm is a complex but kept conceptually simple with the zipper trick. It does not contain monad transformers for the sake of conceptual simplicity, but it is straitforward to develop it further in this way, and has many motivating prospects to do so (tracing, step counting, infinite runaway check).</li>
