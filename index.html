		<h1>My reference works and hobby projects</h1>

		<h2>Standalone web applications and mini custom experimental frameworks</h2>
		<p>Two of my projects are standalone web applications, this I can present them right here, linking as live sites:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<a data-href="http://web.studentadministrationframework.nhely.hu/" target="_blank">My own web application framework</a>,
			</dt>
			<dd>of course a very small and incomplete one, demonstrated on the example of a CRUD application. The site also presents its own <a href="https://github.com/alignalghii/mini-studadmin" target="_blank">source code</a> in a self-documenting style.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<a data-href="http://student-administration-framework.esy.es/focus2-js/1/7" target="_blank">A web gallery</a>,
			</dt>
			<dd>
				based on the web framework above. Most interesting capability of this gallery is graceful degradation through unobtrusive JavaScript that extends a solid core functionality: a nice fallback system turning JavaScripted widgets into simple page-reloding links with the right substitute actions. <a href="https://github.com/alignalghii/free-gallery" target="_blank">Its sourcecode is public on GitHub</a>.
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Scripting and executables</h2>
		<p>I have several minor supplementary projects, most of them are Linux shell programming scripts, or large interesting MySQL scriptfiles fulfilling surprizingly complex tasks with  single query with pure declarative SQL (via mutliple subqueries nd large JOINs).</p>
		<p>Due to their connections to proprietary projects, most of them are not publicable. Some minor public ones are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A <a href="https://github.com/alignalghii/stopwatch-with-alarm/blob/master/stopwatch-with-alarm.bash" target="_blank">stopwatch with alarm clock</a> - written as a bash-script</li>
			<li><a href="https://hub.darcs.net/physis/compact-pivotizer" target="_blank">compact-pivotizer</a>: a large AWK-script for extracting statistical probability deductions from large databases and visualizing dependencies in large pivot tables and graphs.</li>
			<li><a href="https://hub.darcs.net/physis/poreplacer" target="_blank">.po-replacer</a>: a Haskell executable for converting tabular textfiles into po-files for internalization and localization.</li>
		</ul>
