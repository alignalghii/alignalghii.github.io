		<h1>My reference works and hobby projects</<h1>
		<p>I have several minor standalone, most of them are Linux shell programming scripts, or large interesting MySQL scriptfiles fulfilling surprizingly complex tasks with  single query with pure declarative SQL (via mutliple subqueries nd large JOINs).</p>
		<p>But two of my projects are stndlone web applications, this I can present them right here, linking as live sites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://web.studentadministrationframework.nhely.hu/">My own web application framework</a> - of course  very small and incomplete one, demonstrated on the example of a CRUD application. The site also presents its own source code in a self-documenting style.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.student-administration-framework.esy.es/focus2-js/1/3">A web gallery</a>, based on the web framework above. Most interesting capability of this gallery is graceful degradation through unobtrusive JavaScript that extends a solid core functionality: a nice fallback system turning JavaScripted widgets into simple page-reloding links with the right substitute actions. <a href="">Its sourcecode is public on GitHub</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
